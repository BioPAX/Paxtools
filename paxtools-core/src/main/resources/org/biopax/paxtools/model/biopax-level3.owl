    >Definition: An entity feature that represents the resulting physical entity subsequent to a cleavage or degradation event. 

Usage: Fragment Feature can be used to cover multiple types of modfications to the sequence of the physical entity: 
1.    A protein with a single cleavage site that converts the protein into two fragments (e.g. pro-insulin converted to insulin and C-peptide). TODO: CV term for sequence fragment?  PSI-MI CV term for cleavage site?
2.    A protein with two cleavage sites that removes an internal sequence e.g. an intein i.e. ABC -&gt; A
3.    Cleavage of a circular sequence e.g. a plasmid.

In the case of removal ( e.g. intron)  the fragment that is *removed* is specified in the feature location property. In the case of a "cut" (e.g. restriction enzyme cut site) the location of the cut is specified instead.</rdfs:comment>

    >Definition: A single biological relationship between two or more entities. An interaction cannot be defined without the entities it relates.
Comment: Since it is a highly abstract class in the ontology, instances of the interaction class should never be created. Instead, more specific classes should be used. Currently this class only has subclasses that define physical interactions; later levels of BioPAX may define other types of interactions, such as genetic (e.g. synthetic lethal).
Naming rationale: A number of names were considered for this concept, including "process", "synthesis" and "relationship"; Interaction was chosen as it is understood by biologists in a biological context and is compatible with PSI-MI.
Examples: protein-protein interaction, biochemical reaction, enzyme catalysis</rdfs:comment>

    >A continuant that encodes information that can be inherited through replication. 

Gene is often confused with DNA and RNA fragments that are physical encoding of  the gene. Gene is and abstract continuant that can be best described as a "schema".   Gene in BioPAX is a generelization over eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes and  used only for genetic interactions. Gene expression regulation makes use of DNA and RNA physical entities.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Control">
    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Definition: An interaction in which one entity regulates, modifies, or otherwise influences another. Two types of control interactions are defined: activation and inhibition.
Comment: In general, the targets of control processes (i.e. occupants of the CONTROLLED property) should be interactions. Conceptually, physical entities are involved in interactions (or events) and the events should be controlled or modified, not the physical entities themselves. For example, a kinase activating a protein is a frequent event in signaling pathways and is usually represented as an 'activation' arrow from the kinase to the substrate in signaling diagrams. This is an abstraction that can be ambiguous out of context. In BioPAX, this information should be captured as the kinase catalyzing (via an instance of the catalysis class) a reaction in which the substrate is phosphorylated, instead of as a control interaction in which the kinase activates the substrate. Since this class is a superclass for specific types of control, instances of the control class should only be created when none of its subclasses are applicable.
Synonyms: regulation, mediation
Examples: A small molecule that inhibits a pathway by an unknown mechanism controls the pathway.</rdfs:comment>

    >Definition: A conversion interaction that is both a biochemicalReaction and a transport. In transportWithBiochemicalReaction interactions, one or more of the substrates change both their location and their physical structure. Active transport reactions that use ATP as an energy source fall under this category, even if the only covalent change is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.
Comment: This class was added to support a large number of transport events in pathway databases that have a biochemical reaction during the transport process. It is not expected that other double inheritance subclasses will be added to the ontology at the same level as this class.
Examples: In the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system, transportation of sugar into an E. coli cell is accompanied by the sugar's phosphorylation as it crosses the plasma membrane.</rdfs:comment>

Usage: The  top level of the PSI-MI hierarchy partially mirrors the BioPAX interaction  classes. This interaction vocabulary should be used in parallel to BioPAX  classes to more specifically annotate the type of interaction. For example  a BioPAX conversion can be explicated as a phosphorylation. As a best practice, most specific applicable term must be chosen for annotation.

Comment: Multiple interactions may occur in a pathway step, each should be listed in the STEP-INTERACTION property. Order relationships between pathway steps may be established with the NEXT-STEP slot. This order may not be temporally meaningful for specific steps, such as for a pathway loop or a reversible reaction, but represents a directed graph of step relationships that can be useful for describing the overall flow of a pathway, as may be useful in a pathway diagram.
Example: A metabolic pathway may contain a pathway step composed of one biochemical reaction (BR1) and one catalysis (CAT1) instance, where CAT1 describes the catalysis of BR1. The M phase of the cell cycle, defined as a pathway, precedes the G1 phase, also defined as a pathway.</rdfs:comment>

    >Definition: The apparent equilibrium constant, K', and associated values.  Concentrations in the equilibrium constant equation refer to the total concentrations of  all forms of particular biochemical reactants. For example, in the equilibrium constant equation for the biochemical reaction in which ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate:

K' = [ADP][P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]/[ATP],

The concentration of ATP refers to the total concentration of all of the following species:

[ATP] = [ATP&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [HATP&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ATP&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [MgATP&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [MgHATP&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ATP].

The apparent equilibrium constant is formally dimensionless, and can be kept so by inclusion of as many of the terms (1 mol/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) in the numerator or denominator as necessary.  It is a function of temperature (T), ionic strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]). Therefore, these quantities must be specified to be precise, and values for KEQ for biochemical reactions may be represented as 5-tuples of the form (K' T I pH pMg).  This property may have multiple values, representing different measurements for K' obtained under the different experimental conditions listed in the 5-tuple. (This definition adapted from EcoCyc)

    >Definition: A control interaction in which a physical entity (a catalyst) increases the rate of a conversion interaction by lowering its activation energy. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a catalyzing entity and a catalyzed conversion.
Comment: A separate catalysis instance should be created for each different conversion that a physicalEntity may catalyze and for each different physicalEntity that may catalyze a conversion. For example, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two different biochemical reactions would be linked to each of those biochemical reactions by two separate instances of the catalysis class. Also, catalysis reactions from multiple different organisms could be linked to the same generic biochemical reaction (a biochemical reaction is generic if it only includes small molecules). Generally, the enzyme catalyzing a conversion is known and the use of this class is obvious. In the cases where a catalyzed reaction is known to occur but the enzyme is not known, a catalysis instance should be created without a controller specified (i.e. the CONTROLLER property should remain empty).
Synonyms: facilitation, acceleration.
Examples: The catalysis of a biochemical reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction by a membrane pore complex, and the facilitation of a complex assembly by a scaffold protein. Hexokinase -&gt; (The "Glucose + ATP -&gt; Glucose-6-phosphate +ADP" reaction). A plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase is an active transporter (antiport pump) using the energy of ATP to pump Na+ out of the cell and K+ in. Na+ from cytoplasm to extracellular space would be described in a transport instance. K+ from extracellular space to cytoplasm would be described in a transport instance. The ATPase pump would be stored in a catalysis instance controlling each of the above transport instances. A biochemical reaction that does not occur by itself under physiological conditions, but has been observed to occur in the presence of cell extract, likely via one or more unknown enzymes present in the extract, would be stored in the CONTROLLED property, with the CONTROLLER property empty.</rdfs:comment>

    >Genetic interactions between genes occur when two genetic perturbations (e.g. mutations) have a combined phenotypic effect not caused by either perturbation alone. This is not a physical interaction, but rather logical. For example, a synthetic lethal interaction occurs when cell growth is possible without either gene A OR B, but not without both gene A AND B. If you knock out A and B together, the cell will die. A gene participant in a genetic interaction represents the gene that is perturbed.</rdfs:comment>

Comment: This class should be used by default for representing molecular interactions, such as those defined by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction should be listed in the PARTICIPANTS slot. Note that this is one of the few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the interaction class description). If sufficient information on the nature of a molecular interaction is available, a more specific BioPAX interaction class should be used.
Example: Two proteins observed to interact in a yeast-two-hybrid experiment where there is not enough experimental evidence to suggest that the proteins are forming a complex by themselves without any indirect involvement of other proteins. This is the case for most large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens.</rdfs:comment>

Rationale: Utility classes are created when simple slots are insufficient to describe an aspect of an entity or to increase compatibility of this ontology with other standards.  

Instances: The utilityClass class is actually a metaclass and is only present to organize the other helper classes under one class hierarchy; instances of utilityClass should never be created.</rdfs:comment>

    >Definition: A physical entity whose structure is comprised of other physical entities bound to each other non-covalently, at least one of which is a macromolecule (e.g. protein, DNA, or RNA). Complexes must be stable enough to function as a biological unit; in general, the temporary association of an enzyme with its substrate(s) should not be considered or represented as a complex. A complex is the physical product of an interaction (complexAssembly) and is not itself considered an interaction.
Comment: In general, complexes should not be defined recursively so that smaller complexes exist within larger complexes, i.e. a complex should not be a COMPONENT of another complex (see comments on the COMPONENT property). The boundaries on the size of complexes described by this class are not defined here, although elements of the cell as large and dynamic as, e.g., a mitochondrion would typically not be described using this class (later versions of this ontology may include a cellularComponent class to represent these). The strength of binding and the topology of the components cannot be described currently, but may be included in future versions of the ontology, depending on community need.
Examples: Ribosome, RNA polymerase II. Other examples of this class include complexes of multiple protein monomers and complexes of proteins and small molecules.</rdfs:comment>

Comment: There is currently no controlled vocabulary of relationship types for BioPAX, although one will be created in the future if a need develops.
Examples: A link between a gene G in a BioPAX data collection, and the protein product P of that gene in an external database. This is not a unification xref because G and P are different biological entities (one is a gene and one is a protein).

Rationale: BioPAX conciously avoids pysically including CVs and instead references to standard controlled vocabularies for modularity and compatibility. Small lists are occasionaly required when a standard vocabulary does not exist, such as controlType  and conversionDirection.These are included as term restricted properties.

Usage:  As a best practice, CVs should be used whenever possible. Some CVs, agreed on by the BioPAX community as standard,  are listed within subclasses of this class. When an agreed on standard does not exist open, freely available CVs should be preferred.  See also usage for the UnificationXref class in relation to controlled vocabularies.</rdfs:comment>

    >Definition : An entity feature that represent the covalently bound state of  a physical entity. 

Rationale: Most frequent covalent modifications to proteins and DNA, such as phosphorylation and metylation are covered by the ModificationFeature class. In these cases, the added groups are simple and stateless therefore they can be captured by a controlled vocabulary. In other cases, such as ThiS-Thil acyl-disulfide(http://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?type=REACTION&amp;object=RXN-9788), the covalently linked molecules are best represented as a molecular complex. CovalentBindingFeature should be used to model such covalently linked complexes.

Using this construct, it is possible to represent small molecules as a covalent complex of two other small molecules. The demarcation of small
molecules is a general problem and is delegated to small molecule databases.The best practice is not to model using covalent complexes
unless at least one of the participants is a protein, DNA or RNA.

    >Definition: A conversion interaction in which one or more entities (substrates) undergo covalent changes to become one or more other entities (products). The substrates of biochemical reactions are defined in terms of sums of species. This is convention in biochemistry, and, in principle, all of the EC reactions should be biochemical reactions.
Examples: ATP + H2O = ADP + Pi
Comment: In the example reaction above, ATP is considered to be an equilibrium mixture of several species, namely ATP4-, HATP3-, H2ATP2-, MgATP2-, MgHATP-, and Mg2ATP. Additional species may also need to be considered if other ions (e.g. Ca2+) that bind ATP are present. Similar considerations apply to ADP and to inorganic phosphate (Pi). When writing biochemical reactions, it is not necessary to attach charges to the biochemical reactants or to include ions such as H+ and Mg2+ in the equation. The reaction is written in the direction specified by the EC nomenclature system, if applicable, regardless of the physiological direction(s) in which the reaction proceeds. Polymerization reactions involving large polymers whose structure is not explicitly captured should generally be represented as unbalanced reactions in which the monomer is consumed but the polymer remains unchanged, e.g. glycogen + glucose = glycogen.</rdfs:comment>

    >Definition : An entity feature that represent the bound state of a physical entity. A pair of binding features represents a bond. 

Rationale: A physical entity in a molecular complex is considered as a new state of an entity as it is structurally and functionally different. Binding features provide facilities for describing these states. Similar to other features, a molecule can have bound and not-bound states. 

Usage: Typically, binding features are present in pairs, each describing the binding characteristic for one of the interacting physical entities. One exception is using a binding feature with no paired feature to describe any potential binding. For example, an unbound receptor can be described by using a "not-feature" property with an unpaired binding feature as its value.  BindingSiteType and featureLocation allows annotating the binding location.

IntraMolecular property should be set to "true" if the bond links two parts of the same molecule. A pair of binding features are still used where they are owned by the same physical entity. 

If the binding is due to the covalent interactions, for example in the case of lipoproteins, CovalentBindingFeature subclass should be used instead of this class.</rdfs:comment>

    >Imposes ordering on a step in a biochemical pathway. A biochemical reaction can be reversible by itself, but can be physiologically directed in the context of a pathway, for instance due to flux of reactants and products. Only one conversion interaction can be ordered at a time, but multiple catalysis or modulation instances can be part of one step.</rdfs:comment>

    >Definition: A conversion interaction in which an entity (or set of entities) changes location within or with respect to the cell. A transport interaction does not include the transporter entity, even if one is required in order for the transport to occur. Instead, transporters are linked to transport interactions via the catalysis class.
Comment: Transport interactions do not involve chemical changes of the participant(s). These cases are handled by the transportWithBiochemicalReaction class.

Biologically, most modulation interactions describe an interaction in which a small molecule alters the ability of an enzyme to catalyze a specific reaction. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a modulating entity and a catalysis interaction.
Comment: A separate modulation instance should be created for each different catalysis instance that a physical entity may modulate and for each different physical entity that may modulate a catalysis instance. A typical modulation instance has a small molecule as the controller entity and a catalysis instance as the controlled entity.

  <owl:Class rdf:about="#EntityReference">
    <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"
    >Definition: An entity reference is a grouping of several physical entities across different contexts and molecular states, that share common physical properties and often named and treated as a single entity with multiple states by biologists. An entity reference is not a physical entity, it is an abstraction based on 


For DNA, RNA and Proteins the grouping is defined based on a wildtype sequence, for small molecules it is defined by the chemical structure. 


Entity references store the information common to a set of molecules in various states described in the BioPAX document, including database cross-references. For instance, the P53 protein can be phosphorylated in multiple different ways. Each separate P53 protein (pool) in a phosphorylation state would be represented as a different protein (child of physicalEntity) and all things common to all P53 proteins, including all possible phosphorylation sites, the sequence common to all of them and common references to protein databases containing more information about P53 would be stored in a Entity Reference.  

Comment: Many protein, small molecule and gene databases share this point of view, and such a grouping is an important prerequisite for interoperability with those databases. Biologists would often group different pools of molecules in different contexts under the same name. For example cytoplasmic and extracellular calcium have different effects on the cell's behavior, but they are still called calcium. This grouping has three semantic implications:

1.  Members of different pools share many physical and biochemical properties. This includes their chemical structure, sequence, organism and set of molecules they react with. They will also share a lot of secondary information such as their names, functional groupings, annotation terms and database identifiers.

2. A small number of transitions seperates these pools. In other words it is relatively easy and frequent for a molecule to transform from one physical entity to another that belong to the same reference entity. For example an extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, and p53 can become phosphorylated. However no calcium virtually becomes sodium, or no p53 becomes mdm2. In the former it is the sheer energy barrier of a nuclear reaction, in the latter sheer statistical improbability of synthesizing the same sequence without a template. If one thinks about the biochemical network as molecules transforming into each other, and remove edges that respond to transcription, translation, degradation and covalent modification of small molecules, each remaining component is a reference entity.

3. Some of the pools in the same group can overlap. p53-p@ser15 can overlap with p53-p@thr18. Most of the experiments in molecular biology will only check for one state variable, rarely multiple, and never for the all possible combinations. So almost all statements that refer to the state of the molecule talk about a pool that can overlap with other pools. However no overlaps is possible between molecules of different groups.</rdfs:comment>

Comment: This class serves as the super-class for all physical entities, although its current set of subclasses is limited to molecules. As a highly abstract class in the ontology, instances of the physicalEntity class should never be created. Instead, more specific classes should be used.
Synonyms: part, interactor, object
Naming rationale: It's difficult to find a name that encompasses all of the subclasses of this class without being too general. E.g. PSI-MI uses 'interactor', BIND uses 'object', BioCyc uses 'chemicals'. physicalEntity seems to be a good name for this specialization of entity.

Comment: This class is designed to represent a simple, single-step transformation. Multi-step transformations, such as the conversion of glucose to pyruvate in the glycolysis pathway, should be represented as pathways, if known. Since it is a highly abstract class in the ontology, instances of the conversion class should never be created. More specific classes should be used instead.

Rationale: In Biology, identity of DNA, RNA and Protein entities are defined around a wildtype sequence. Covalent modifications to this basal sequence are represented using modificaton features. Since small molecules are identified based on their chemical structure, not sequence, a covalent modification to a small molecule would result in a different molecule. 

Usage: The added groups should be simple and stateless, such as phosphate or methyl groups and are captured by the modificationType controlled vocabulary. In other cases, such as covalently linked proteins, use CovalentBindingFeature instead. 

Instances: A phosphorylation on a protein, a methylation on a DNA.</rdfs:comment>

    >Description: A characteristic of a physical entity that can change while the entity still retains its biological identity. 

Rationale: Two phosphorylated forms of a protein are strictly speaking different chemical  molecules. It is, however, standard in biology to treat them as different states of the same entity, where the entity is loosely defined based on sequence. Entity Feature class and its subclassses captures these variable characteristics. A Physical Entity in BioPAX represents a pool of  molecules rather than an individual molecule. This is a notion imported from chemistry( See PhysicalEntity). Pools are defined by a set of Entity Features in the sense that a single molecule must have all of the features in the set in order to be considered a member of the pool. Since it is impossible to list and experimentally test all potential features for an  entity, features that are not listed in the selection criteria is neglected Pools can also be defined by the converse by specifying features  that are known to NOT exist in a specific context. As DNA, RNA and Proteins can be hierarchicaly organized into families based on sequence homology so can entity features. The memberFeature property allows capturing such hierarchical classifications among entity features.

&amp;lt;todo describe evidence??&amp;gt;

Usage: Subclasses of entity feature describe most common biological instances and sholud be preferred whenever possible. One common usecase for instatiating entity feature is, for describing active/inactive states of proteins where more specific feature information is not available.  

Instances: Open/close conformational state of channel proteins, "active"/"inactive" states, excited states of photoreactive groups.</rdfs:comment>

    >Definiition: A term that describes the form of the physical entity in the context of the experiment. This is a reference to the PSI Molecular Interaction ontology (MI) participant identification method (e.g. mass spectrometry), experimental role (e.g. bait, prey) or experimental preparation (e.g. expression level) type.

    >This quantity is dimensionless and is usually a single number. The measured equilibrium constant for a biochemical reaction, encoded by the slot KEQ, is actually the apparent equilibrium constant, K'.  Concentrations in the equilibrium constant equation refer to the total concentrations of  all forms of particular biochemical reactants. For example, in the equilibrium constant equation for the biochemical reaction in which ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate:

K' = [ADP][P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]/[ATP],

The concentration of ATP refers to the total concentration of all of the following species:

[ATP] = [ATP&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [HATP&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ATP&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [MgATP&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [MgHATP&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ATP].

The apparent equilibrium constant is formally dimensionless, and can be kept so by inclusion of as many of the terms (1 mol/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) in the numerator or denominator as necessary.  It is a function of temperature (T), ionic strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]). Therefore, these quantities must be specified to be precise, and values for KEQ for biochemical reactions may be represented as 5-tuples of the form (K' T I pH pMg).  This property may have multiple values, representing different measurements for K' obtained under the different experimental conditions listed in the 5-tuple.

    >Defines the nature of the control relationship between the CONTROLLER and the CONTROLLED entities.

The following terms are possible values:

ACTIVATION: General activation. Compounds that activate the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.

The following term can not be used in the catalysis class:
INHIBITION: General inhibition. Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.

The following terms can only be used in the modulation class (these definitions from EcoCyc):
INHIBITION-ALLOSTERIC
Allosteric inhibitors decrease the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that decreases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX. Allosteric inhibitors can be competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors, therefore, those inhibition categories can be used in conjunction with this category.

INHIBITION-COMPETITIVE
Competitive inhibitors are compounds that competitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and preventing the substrate from binding. Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme. A competitive inhibitor can either bind to the active site of the enzyme, directly excluding the substrate from binding there, or it can bind to another site on the enzyme, altering the conformation of the enzyme such that the substrate can not bind to the active site.

INHIBITION-IRREVERSIBLE
Irreversible inhibitors are compounds that irreversibly inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding to the enzyme and dissociating so slowly that it is considered irreversible. For example, alkylating agents, such as iodoacetamide, irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.

INHIBITION-NONCOMPETITIVE
Noncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that noncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme by binding reversibly to both the free enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex. The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other. However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.

INHIBITION-OTHER
Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized, but that cannot be clearly classified as irreversible, competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, or allosteric.

INHIBITION-UNCOMPETITIVE
Uncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that uncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex but not to the enzyme alone.

ACTIVATION-NONALLOSTERIC
Nonallosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by means other than allosteric.

ACTIVATION-ALLOSTERIC
Allosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.</rdfs:comment>

    >A cellular location, e.g. 'cytoplasm'. This should reference a term in the Gene Ontology Cellular Component ontology. The location referred to by this property should be as specific as is known. If an interaction is known to occur in multiple locations, separate interactions (and physicalEntityParticipants) must be created for each different location. Note: If a location is unknown then the GO term for 'cellular component unknown' (GO:0008372) should be used in the LOCATION property. If the location of a participant in a complex is unspecified, it may be assumed to be the same location as that of the complex. In case of conflicting information, the location of the most outer layer of any nesting should be considered correct. Note: Cellular location describes a specific location of a physical entity as it would be used in e.g. a transport reaction. It does not describe all of the possible locations that the physical entity could be in the cell.</rdfs:comment>

    >The apparent equilibrium constant K'. Concentrations in the equilibrium constant equation refer to the total concentrations of  all forms of particular biochemical reactants. For example, in the equilibrium constant equation for the biochemical reaction in which ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate:

K' = [ADP][P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]/[ATP],

The concentration of ATP refers to the total concentration of all of the following species:

[ATP] = [ATP&lt;sup&gt;4-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [HATP&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ATP&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [MgATP&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [MgHATP&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] + [Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ATP].

The apparent equilibrium constant is formally dimensionless, and can be kept so by inclusion of as many of the terms (1 mol/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) in the numerator or denominator as necessary.  It is a function of temperature (T), ionic strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]).

    >For biochemical reactions, this property refers to the standard transformed Gibbs energy change for a reaction written in terms of biochemical reactants (sums of species), delta-G'&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

  delta-G'&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = -RT lnK'
and
  delta-G'&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; = delta-H'&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; - T delta-S'&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

delta-G'&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; has units of kJ/mol.  Like K', it is a function of temperature (T), ionic strength (I), pH, and pMg (pMg = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]). Therefore, these quantities must be specified, and values for DELTA-G for biochemical reactions are represented as 5-tuples of the form (delta-G'&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; T I pH pMg).

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Defines the PhysicalEntity subunits of this complex. This property should not contain other complexes, i.e. it should always be a flat representation of the complex. For example, if two protein complexes join to form a single larger complex via a complex assembly interaction, the component of the new complex should be the individual proteins of the smaller complexes, not the two smaller complexes themselves. Exceptions are black-box complexes (i.e. complexes in which the component property is empty), which may be used as component of other complexes because their constituent parts are unknown / unspecified. The reason for keeping complexes flat is to signify that there is no information stored in the way complexes are nested, such as assembly order. Otherwise, the complex assembly order may be implicitly encoded and interpreted by some users, while others created hierarchical complexes randomly, which could lead to data loss. Additionally, the physicalEntityParticipants used in the component property are in the context of the complex, thus should not be reused between complexes.  For instance, a protein may participate in two different complexes, but have different conformation in each.</rdfs:comment>
