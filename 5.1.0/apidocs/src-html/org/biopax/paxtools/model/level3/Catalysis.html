<span class="sourceLineNo">007</span> * Definition: A control interaction in which a physical entity (a catalyst) increases the rate of a conversion<a name="line.7"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">008</span> * interaction by lowering its activation energy. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a catalyzing<a name="line.8"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">009</span> * entity and a catalyzed conversion.<a name="line.9"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">010</span> *<a name="line.10"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span> * Rationale: Catalysis, theoretically, is always bidirectional since it acts by lowering the activation energy.<a name="line.11"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span> * Physiologically, however, it can have a direction because of the concentration of the participants. For example,<a name="line.12"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span> * the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by Isocitrate dehydrogenase always happens in one direction under<a name="line.13"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span> * physiological conditions since the produced carbon dioxide is constantly removed from the system.<a name="line.14"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span> *<a name="line.15"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span> * Usage: A separate catalysis instance should be created for each different conversion that a physicalEntity may<a name="line.16"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span> * catalyze and for each different physicalEntity that may catalyze a conversion. For example,<a name="line.17"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two different biochemical reactions would be linked to each of those<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> * biochemical reactions by two separate instances of the catalysis class. Also, catalysis reactions from multiple<a name="line.19"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span> * different organisms could be linked to the same generic biochemical reaction (a biochemical reaction is generic if<a name="line.20"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span> * it only includes small molecules). Generally, the enzyme catalyzing a conversion is known and the use of this<a name="line.21"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span> * class is obvious, however, in the cases where a catalyzed reaction is known to occur but the enzyme is not known,<a name="line.22"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span> * a catalysis instance can be created without a controller specified.<a name="line.23"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> *<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * Synonyms: facilitation, acceleration.<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> *<a name="line.26"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span> * Examples: The catalysis of a biochemical reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction by a<a name="line.27"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span> * membrane pore complex, and the facilitation of a complex assembly by a scaffold protein. Hexokinase -&amp;gt; (The<a name="line.28"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * "Glucose + ATP -&amp;gt; Glucose-6-phosphate +ADP" reaction). A plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase is an active transporter<a name="line.29"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span> * (antiport pump) using the energy of ATP to pump Na+ out of the cell and K+ in. Na+ from cytoplasm to extracellular<a name="line.30"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span> * space would be described in a transport instance. K+ from extracellular space to cytoplasm would be described in a<a name="line.31"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span> * transport instance. The ATPase pump would be stored in a catalysis instance controlling each of the above<a name="line.32"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">033</span> * transport instances. A biochemical reaction that does not occur by itself under physiological conditions,<a name="line.33"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">034</span> * but has been observed to occur in the presence of cell extract, likely via one or more unknown enzymes present in<a name="line.34"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">035</span> * the extract, would be stored in the CONTROLLED property, with the CONTROLLER property empty.<a name="line.35"></a>
