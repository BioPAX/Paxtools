<span class="sourceLineNo">004</span> * Definition: An interaction in which one entity regulates, modifies, or otherwise influences another. Two types of<a name="line.4"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">005</span> * control interactions are defined: activation and inhibition.<a name="line.5"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">006</span> *<a name="line.6"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">007</span> * Comment: The targets of control processes (i.e. values of the controlled property) should be Interactions or<a name="line.7"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">008</span> * Pathways, not physical entities. The physical entities are involved in processes,<a name="line.8"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">009</span> * which are controlled.  The physical entities are not themselves controlled. For example,<a name="line.9"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">010</span> * a kinase activating a protein is a frequent event in signaling pathways and is usually represented in signaling<a name="line.10"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">011</span> * diagrams using an ‘activation’ arrow from the kinase to the substrate. The problem with this is that the substrate<a name="line.11"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">012</span> * may not be active in other contexts. For this reason, BioPAX does not support these types of control or activation<a name="line.12"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">013</span> * flow networks. In BioPAX, this information should be captured as the kinase catalyzing (via an instance of the<a name="line.13"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">014</span> * Catalysis class) a reaction in which the substrate is phosphorylated.<a name="line.14"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">015</span> *<a name="line.15"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">016</span> * Synonyms: regulation, mediation<a name="line.16"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">017</span> *<a name="line.17"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">018</span> * Examples: A small molecule that inhibits a pathway by an unknown mechanism controls the pathway.<a name="line.18"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">019</span> *<a name="line.19"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">020</span> * Notes: Instances of Control can have multiple controller’s and controlled’s. Moreover,<a name="line.20"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">021</span> * one Control instance can control another Control instance. The semantics of the use of these properties are as<a name="line.21"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">022</span> * follows:<a name="line.22"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">023</span> *<a name="line.23"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">024</span> * Multiple separate controls controlling a conversion means that they control in parallel (e.g. different enzymes<a name="line.24"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">025</span> * catalyzing the same reaction). Generally, their effect on the rate of the reaction is cumulative.<a name="line.25"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">026</span> *<a name="line.26"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">027</span> * A control with multiple controllers indicates a dependency between these controllers,<a name="line.27"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">028</span> * typically meaning that both are required for the reaction to occur (e.g. a catalysis with an enzyme and a cofactor<a name="line.28"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * as controllers). Any further chaining of controls also implies dependency, for example allosteric inhibition of<a name="line.29"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">030</span> * the aforementioned enzyme by a small molecule.<a name="line.30"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">031</span> *<a name="line.31"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">032</span> * Here is a pseudo-BioPAX representation of the examples above:<a name="line.32"></a>

<span class="sourceLineNo">046</span> * cat1 has controlled rxn1<a name="line.46"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">047</span> * cat2 has controlled rxn1 (Both cat1 and cat2 can catalyze rxn1, independently)<a name="line.47"></a>

<span class="sourceLineNo">052</span> * cat2 has cofactor cofactor1 (both enzyme2 and cofactor1 is required for cat2 to occur)<a name="line.52"></a>

<span class="sourceLineNo">056</span> * mod1 has controller drug1 (drug1 should NOT be present for cat2 to occur)<a name="line.56"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">057</span> *<a name="line.57"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">058</span> * This structure is similar to disjunctive normal form (DNF) in Boolean logic. We could write this as: (enzyme1) OR<a name="line.58"></a>
