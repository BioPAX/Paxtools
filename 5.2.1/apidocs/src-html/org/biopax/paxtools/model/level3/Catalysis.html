<span class="source-line-no">007</span><span id="line-7"> * Definition: A control interaction in which a physical entity (a catalyst) increases the rate of a conversion</span>
<span class="source-line-no">008</span><span id="line-8"> * interaction by lowering its activation energy. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a catalyzing</span>
<span class="source-line-no">009</span><span id="line-9"> * entity and a catalyzed conversion.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line-10"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">011</span><span id="line-11"> * Rationale: Catalysis, theoretically, is always bidirectional since it acts by lowering the activation energy.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">012</span><span id="line-12"> * Physiologically, however, it can have a direction because of the concentration of the participants. For example,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line-13"> * the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by Isocitrate dehydrogenase always happens in one direction under</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line-14"> * physiological conditions since the produced carbon dioxide is constantly removed from the system.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">015</span><span id="line-15"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">016</span><span id="line-16"> * Usage: A separate catalysis instance should be created for each different conversion that a physicalEntity may</span>
<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line-17"> * catalyze and for each different physicalEntity that may catalyze a conversion. For example,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line-18"> * a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two different biochemical reactions would be linked to each of those</span>
<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line-19"> * biochemical reactions by two separate instances of the catalysis class. Also, catalysis reactions from multiple</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line-20"> * different organisms could be linked to the same generic biochemical reaction (a biochemical reaction is generic if</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line-21"> * it only includes small molecules). Generally, the enzyme catalyzing a conversion is known and the use of this</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line-22"> * class is obvious, however, in the cases where a catalyzed reaction is known to occur but the enzyme is not known,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line-23"> * a catalysis instance can be created without a controller specified.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">024</span><span id="line-24"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line-25"> * Synonyms: facilitation, acceleration.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line-26"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">027</span><span id="line-27"> * Examples: The catalysis of a biochemical reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction by a</span>
<span class="source-line-no">028</span><span id="line-28"> * membrane pore complex, and the facilitation of a complex assembly by a scaffold protein. Hexokinase -&amp;gt; (The</span>
<span class="source-line-no">029</span><span id="line-29"> * "Glucose + ATP -&amp;gt; Glucose-6-phosphate +ADP" reaction). A plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase is an active transporter</span>
<span class="source-line-no">030</span><span id="line-30"> * (antiport pump) using the energy of ATP to pump Na+ out of the cell and K+ in. Na+ from cytoplasm to extracellular</span>
<span class="source-line-no">031</span><span id="line-31"> * space would be described in a transport instance. K+ from extracellular space to cytoplasm would be described in a</span>
<span class="source-line-no">032</span><span id="line-32"> * transport instance. The ATPase pump would be stored in a catalysis instance controlling each of the above</span>
<span class="source-line-no">033</span><span id="line-33"> * transport instances. A biochemical reaction that does not occur by itself under physiological conditions,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">034</span><span id="line-34"> * but has been observed to occur in the presence of cell extract, likely via one or more unknown enzymes present in</span>
<span class="source-line-no">035</span><span id="line-35"> * the extract, would be stored in the CONTROLLED property, with the CONTROLLER property empty.</span>
