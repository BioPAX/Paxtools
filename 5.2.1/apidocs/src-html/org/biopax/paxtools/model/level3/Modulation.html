<span class="source-line-no">004</span><span id="line-4"> * Definition: An interaction in which one entity regulates, modifies, or otherwise influences another. Two types of</span>
<span class="source-line-no">005</span><span id="line-5"> * control interactions are defined: activation and inhibition.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">006</span><span id="line-6"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">007</span><span id="line-7"> * Comment: The targets of control processes (i.e. values of the controlled property) should be Interactions or</span>
<span class="source-line-no">008</span><span id="line-8"> * Pathways, not physical entities. The physical entities are involved in processes,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">009</span><span id="line-9"> * which are controlled.  The physical entities are not themselves controlled. For example,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line-10"> * a kinase activating a protein is a frequent event in signaling pathways and is usually represented in signaling</span>
<span class="source-line-no">011</span><span id="line-11"> * diagrams using an ‘activation’ arrow from the kinase to the substrate. The problem with this is that the substrate</span>
<span class="source-line-no">012</span><span id="line-12"> * may not be active in other contexts. For this reason, BioPAX does not support these types of control or activation</span>
<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line-13"> * flow networks. In BioPAX, this information should be captured as the kinase catalyzing (via an instance of the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line-14"> * Catalysis class) a reaction in which the substrate is phosphorylated.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">015</span><span id="line-15"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">016</span><span id="line-16"> * Synonyms: regulation, mediation</span>
<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line-17"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line-18"> * Examples: A small molecule that inhibits a pathway by an unknown mechanism controls the pathway.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">019</span><span id="line-19"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line-20"> * Notes: Instances of Control can have multiple controller’s and controlled’s. Moreover,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line-21"> * one Control instance can control another Control instance. The semantics of the use of these properties are as</span>
<span class="source-line-no">022</span><span id="line-22"> * follows:</span>
<span class="source-line-no">023</span><span id="line-23"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">024</span><span id="line-24"> * Multiple separate controls controlling a conversion means that they control in parallel (e.g. different enzymes</span>
<span class="source-line-no">025</span><span id="line-25"> * catalyzing the same reaction). Generally, their effect on the rate of the reaction is cumulative.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">026</span><span id="line-26"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">027</span><span id="line-27"> * A control with multiple controllers indicates a dependency between these controllers,</span>
<span class="source-line-no">028</span><span id="line-28"> * typically meaning that both are required for the reaction to occur (e.g. a catalysis with an enzyme and a cofactor</span>
<span class="source-line-no">029</span><span id="line-29"> * as controllers). Any further chaining of controls also implies dependency, for example allosteric inhibition of</span>
<span class="source-line-no">030</span><span id="line-30"> * the aforementioned enzyme by a small molecule.</span>
