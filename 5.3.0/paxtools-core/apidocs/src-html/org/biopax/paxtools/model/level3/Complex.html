<span class="source-line-no">006</span><span id="line-6"> * &lt;b&gt;Definition&lt;/b&gt;: A physical entity whose structure is comprised of other physical entities bound to each other</span>
<span class="source-line-no">007</span><span id="line-7"> * non-covalently, at least one of which is a macromolecule (e.g. protein, DNA, or RNA). Complexes must be stable enough</span>
<span class="source-line-no">008</span><span id="line-8"> * to function as a biological unit; in general, the temporary association of an enzyme with its substrate(s) should not</span>
<span class="source-line-no">009</span><span id="line-9"> * be considered or represented as a complex. A complex is the physical product of an interaction (complexAssembly) and</span>
<span class="source-line-no">010</span><span id="line-10"> * is not itself considered an interaction.</span>
<span class="source-line-no">011</span><span id="line-11"> *</span>
<span class="source-line-no">012</span><span id="line-12"> * &lt;b&gt;Comment&lt;/b&gt;: In general, complexes should not be defined recursively so that smaller complexes exist within larger</span>
<span class="source-line-no">013</span><span id="line-13"> * complexes, i.e. a complex should not be a COMPONENT of another complex (see comments on the COMPONENT property). The</span>
<span class="source-line-no">014</span><span id="line-14"> * boundaries on the size of complexes described by this class are not defined here, although elements of the cell as</span>
<span class="source-line-no">015</span><span id="line-15"> * large and dynamic as, e.g., a mitochondrion would typically not be described using this class (later versions of this</span>
<span class="source-line-no">016</span><span id="line-16"> * ontology may include a cellularComponent class to represent these). The strength of binding and the topology of the</span>
<span class="source-line-no">017</span><span id="line-17"> * components cannot be described currently, but may be included in future versions of the ontology, depending on</span>
<span class="source-line-no">018</span><span id="line-18"> * community need.</span>

<span class="source-line-no">020</span><span id="line-20"> * &lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;: Ribosome, RNA polymerase II. Other examples of this class include complexes of multiple protein</span>
<span class="source-line-no">021</span><span id="line-21"> * monomers and complexes of proteins and small molecules.</span>
